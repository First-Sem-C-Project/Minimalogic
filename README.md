  Does any other digital logic simulator allow you to do THIS? Maybe not! Definitely not!!

## What is Minimalogic?
Minimalogic is a simple digital logic simulator made in C using SDL2 as a project for completion of the course Computer Programming [CT 401]. It was coded with a specific objective of getting the simulation job done easily, the curiousity emanated from our regular Digital Logics lab.<br>

## Building and Executing

**This project can only be built on x64 Windows systems**
1. Clone this repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/First-Sem-C-Project/Minimalogic/
```
2. Change directory to 'Minimalogic'
```shell
cd .\Minimalogic
```
3. Execute the build.bat script
```shell
.\build.bat
```
4. Wait for build.bat to finish. It will download libraries and fonts required by the project and then build it.
5. Go to `bin\ClangBuild` or `bin\GccBuild` or `bin\MSVCBuild` and run `Minimalogic.exe`
6. Enjoy?
