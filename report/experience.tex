    \chapter{Experience and Insights Gained}
	When we started working on this project, we were sure it would be an interesting experience, but what we did not anticipate was the sheer number of challenges that would come along. Challenges that proved the knowledge gained from our course to be insufficient for a project of this level. Algorithms that were unfamiliar to us had to be used for various parts of the program. But, along the way, we learned that these challenges were part of the learning experience.
As futile as it may be, we've tried to make a list of what we learned by doing this project:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Organizing the project and making the source code readable by using multiple files and using a consistent naming convention.}
        \item{Collaborative work with VCS like Git and remote hosting services like GitHub.}
        \item{Using the official documentation of Libraries and the C language itself.}
        \item{Unique algorithms for things like drawing curves, collision detection, etc.}
        \item{Avoiding memory leaks and other vulnerabilities that are exposed in low level language such as C.}
    \end{enumerate}
