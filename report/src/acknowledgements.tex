\chapter*{\centering Acknowledgements}

First of all, we would like to express our gratitude to our teacher, Anku Jaiswal, for her constant support and guidance throughout the semester.
The lectures, assignments and guidelines have been of great help for us to successfully complete our project.

We would also like to thank IOE, Pulchowk campus and Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering for providing us an opportunity to work on this project.
We have enhanced our programming skills in C language, and learnt to work as a team in the past few weeks. Our friends and seniors have also been incredibly helpful in figuring out this whole "teamwork for a project" scenario by sharing their knowledge and critique, this helped in shaping the outline and rectifying the elements of our project. 
We feel immensely thankful to be surrounded by such supportive, kind and obliging people. Our families have also played a huge role by providing us the support we needed-both emotional and mental-without which finishing the project would have been impossible.
We would like to thank everyone who has directly or indirectly contributed to the project.
