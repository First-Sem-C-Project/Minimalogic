\chapter*{\centering Acknowledgements}

First of all, we would like to express our gratitude to our teacher, Anku Jaiswal for her constant support and guidance throughout the semester.
The lectures, assignments and guidelines have been of great help for us to successfully complete our project.

We would also like to thank IOE, Pulchowk campus and Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering for providing us an opportunity to work on this project.
We have enhanced our programming skills in C language, and learnt to work as a team in the past few weeks. Our friends and seniors have also been very helpful, and have shared their knowledge and feedback to make our application better and efficient.
So we really feel thankful to be surrounded by such kind people. Our families have also played a huge role by providing us the resources required and constant support without which finishing the project would have been impossible.
We would like to thank them, as well as anyone who has directly or indirectly contributed to the project.
